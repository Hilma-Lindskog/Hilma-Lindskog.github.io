I am a PhD candidate at the Department of Political Science since 2022.

My dissertation focuses on the influence of education on political attitudes and lies at the intersection of political sociology and political economy. I investigate this topic both through processes occurring during the time spent in education and through the transition to the labor market.

A second research interest concerns how voters act and express themselves politically based on their social environment. In this area, I study how behaviors and attitudes of voters supporting radical right parties relate to the degree of social acceptance of these parties. I work primarily with quantitative methods.
