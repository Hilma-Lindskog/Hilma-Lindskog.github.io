    <h1><strong>Hilma</strong> Lindskog</h1>
    <p>Hi!</p>
    <p>
        I am a PhD candidate at the Department of Political Science since 2022.
    </p>
    <p>
        My dissertation focuses on the influence of education on political attitudes and lies at the intersection of political sociology and political economy. I investigate this topic through both processes that occur during education and through processes involved in the transition to the labor market.
    </p>
    <p>
        A second research interest of mine concerns how voters act and express themselves politically based on their social environment. In this area, I study how the behaviors and attitudes of voters supporting radical right parties relate to the degree of social acceptance for these parties. I primarily work with quantitative methods.
